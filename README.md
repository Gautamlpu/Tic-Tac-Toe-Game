# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a very popular paper-pencil game often played in classrooms on the last page of the notebook. In this game, two players mark X or 0 one by one in a 3x3 grid. To win the game, one has to complete a pair of 3 symbols in a line, and that can be a horizontal line, a vertical line, or a diagonal line.
